# Introduction  

YAML, is a very highly *compact* way to store serialisation files/data;   
that can be used for the purpose of data exchange...;  
meaning, files that can be exchanged between programs.  

The reason why the format is so compact is because it uses *indentation*...;    
in the same way that Python programming code makes extensive use of *indentation*;      
and, this results in files that are much clearer to read/understand;     
as well as, being far more *compact*.  

YAML files are saved using either:    
- .yaml  
- .yml  
...filename extension.
