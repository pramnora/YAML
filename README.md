# Introduction  

YAML, is a very compact way to store serialisation files/data.  

The reason why the format is so compact is it uses *indentation*...;    
in the same way that Python files make powerful use of *indentation*;    
and, this results in files which are much clearer to read/understand;   
as well as, being far more compact.  

YAML files are saved using either:    
- .yaml  
- .yml  
...filename extension.
